# VFloors360-Admin
VFloors360-Admin is the administrative dashboard for managing the VFloors360 virtual room visualization platform. It enables admins to upload and organize 3D room models, manage tile textures and categories, configure system settings, and monitor VR content in real-time. Built with React, Redux, and Axios, this panel ensures seamless content control and backend integration with the VFloors360-Client, supporting a dynamic and immersive user experience in virtual interior design.

## 📘 Overview

**VFloors360-Admin** is the administrative dashboard for the VFloors360 ecosystem, supporting management of room models, tile assets, and other configurations required for immersive 360-degree VR visualization of interior spaces.

This admin interface complements the VR client application by providing the tools necessary for uploading, organizing, and maintaining the assets used in the client-side environment.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Component-based UI development
- **Redux** – State management
- **Axios** – API communication
- **Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS** – Responsive UI design
- **Node.js & Express (optional backend)** – For API and asset management
- **MongoDB / Firebase / Supabase (optional)** – Storage solutions for model and texture metadata

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Upload 3D models (.glb/.gltf) with associated metadata
- ✅ Manage tile and texture assets (floor, wall, door, etc.)
- ✅ Real-time preview of uploaded content
- ✅ Categorize models by room type (e.g., kitchen, bathroom)
- ✅ Edit or delete room configurations
- ✅ Secure admin authentication (planned)
- ✅ Role-based access control (future enhancement)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **npm** (v9 or later)

## 🔌 API Integration

**Endpoints Used:**

- `GET /api/models` – Fetch uploaded room models
- `POST /api/models` – Upload new models
- `DELETE /api/models/:id` – Remove a model
- `GET /api/tiles` – List tile textures
- `POST /api/tiles` – Upload new tiles

> NOTE: Ensure the backend service is up and configured for CORS support.

## 🧪 Testing

- Manual testing through UI
- Integration testing of API routes
- Form validation for model uploads
- Feedback collection from internal stakeholders

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy this application using platforms like:

- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Firebase Hosting**

Run the build command:

```bash
